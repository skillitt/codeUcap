My project is to take an exel file with a bank of phone numbers that we assign users in the agency and automate the process.
Right now the process is to create the user account in Active Directory, open an excel spreadsheet and locate an available phone number, assign it to the user, move the number to the unavailble column and document the user information manually.

The goal is to create a process to have the phone numbers in a data base, search availble numbers and claim the number and move to the unavaible list.

Still working on this information:
    • Identify 3+ features from the provided list that you've integrated.
    • Add any special instructions for the reviewer to run your project.
